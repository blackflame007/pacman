# Pacman Go Clone

Welcome to the Pacman Game! 

This is a text-based implementation of the classic Pacman game where you control Pacman and try to collect all the dots while avoiding the ghosts.

## How to Play

The goal of the game is to collect all the dots while avoiding the ghosts.

Move Pacman using the W, A, S, and D keys to navigate through the maze.

Collect dots (.) to increase your score.
Power pellets (O) give Pacman the ability to eat the ghosts and earn extra points.
Avoid the ghosts (G). 

If you collide with a ghost, you lose a life.
You start the game with 3 lives. If you lose all your lives, the game is over.

The game ends when you collect all the dots or lose all your lives.
